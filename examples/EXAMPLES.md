## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific about your goal**: "I need this for writing" vs. "I need this for implementation"
2. **Choose appropriate depth**: Don't use Level 4 for simple articles
3. **Provide context**: Share what you already know or what confuses you
4. **Iterate**: Ask follow-up questions to dive deeper into specific areas
5. **Request specific outputs**: Ask for the format that serves your purpose
